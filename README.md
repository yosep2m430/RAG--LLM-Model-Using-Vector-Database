We are living in an age surrounded by countless machine learning models. We're inundated by even more possibilities- to better everyone's lives. An area where machine learning technology can be useful is healthcare. There are different areas within healthcare, from payments to treatments, that pose uncertainties. Going through medical treatments are difficult and financially burdensome, but even with enough means, whether a patient will receive a treatment needed/ wanted is not certain.

This chatbot allows one to accurately predict the healthcare's treatment plan decision after providing treatment history, report year, demographical information (i.e. age, gender), and finding. It leverages power of LLM, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Pinecone's vector database to quickly process and retrieve accurate information.

### Outcome:
Our chatbot has successfully given us accurate prediction of healthcare plan decision based on information predicted. Other top 5 "similar" vectors around our result have very high similarity score of roughly 93%, as well as consistent answer. This demonstrates that our RAG LLM chatbot will be able to extract relevant information and contexts to make accurate predictions reliably.


### Potential applications:
1. Patients
2. Healthcare Providers- Having such model as a chatbot allows one to easily support one's treatment plan decision, allowing one to be confident in one's decision. Furthermore, having access to such powerful tool allows one to quickly access many precedences, without having to forage large records, to protect themselves, should their decisions and practices be challenged.
